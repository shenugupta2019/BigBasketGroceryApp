/*

Single Responsibility:-  There is only one responsibily should be there for the class to perform
Open/Closed Priniciple- class should not change their existing functionality and able to extend the new functonality without changing existing code
Liskov/Substitution- when derive class extend the features of base class then the subclass should not break their functionality by unnecessary used the 
methods of subclass. So its better to use seperate interfaces and class should conform those interfaces without breaking 
subclass functionality
Dependency inversion- High level interfaces should be created without showing low level features of classes and components.
seperate interfaces should create and classes should use those interfaces
